# Poe Speedrun

This project was my first fullstack project using mainly Laravel.
I done it alone in a week. It is not finished but i wont work on it anymore.

## Project

This is a copy of the Path of Exile category on the website speedrun.com

## Build

Run the following command:
`composer install`
config the .env file (you can copy the .env.example then modify it with your db)
`php artisan key:generate`
`php artisan migrate`
`php artisan serve`

## Todo

I won't work anymore on this project but this is what I have planned if i would continue working on it:

-   Create the pages stats
-   Fix and finish the search menu

## Known bug to fix

-   The submit new run throw a new error (was working fine before ??)
